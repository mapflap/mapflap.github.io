Droughts are natural extreme events related to the reduction of water resources availability. Challenges in predicting droughts still remain, especially for sub-seasonal lead-times. In this work, we aim to combine a statistical framework and a Machine Learning (ML) model to detect the links between large-scale climate variables and local precipitation, and exploit them to predict monthly cumulative precipitation with a Neural Network.",technologies:[{id:11,name:"Matplotlib",image:"\u002Ftechnologies\u002Fmatplotlib.png"},{id:12,name:"Pandas",image:"\u002Ftechnologies\u002Fpandas.png"},{id:13,name:"Tensorflow",image:"\u002Ftechnologies\u002Ftensorflow.png"},{id:14,name:"Xarray",image:"\u002Ftechnologies\u002Fxarray.png"},{id:15,name:"Bokeh",image:"\u002Ftechnologies\u002Fbokeh.png"}],url:"\u002Fhidden\u002FBosso_Francesco_presentation.pdf",finished:1,short:"ML4Drought"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0});
